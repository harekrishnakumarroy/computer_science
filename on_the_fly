cargo
Cargo is Rust's build system and package manager. Using cargo, adding dependency is much easier.

Few cargo commands:
cargo new project
cd project
cargo build
cargo run

.cargo/config.toml
Alternate registry can be added in .cargo/config.toml

What is Crate ?
A crate is a smallest compilation unit in rust.
Eg: rustc somefile.rs, here somefile.rs is a crate file.

A crate can come in two forms: a binary crate and library crates.
